# FastGliders
This is a colony survival mod created by nickmcski. You may download the original mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2322409810). I have 
forked the mod so that user moderation can be added. Allowing users to set speeds higher than even admins can travel is crazy. While the default gliders do need adjusted, 
there needs to be a limit.

This version of the mod comes with those limits. It also comes in a ready to download and deploy fashion. So no needing a workshop mod page. Simply download the release, 
place it in your mods folder, and you're done.

# Install Notes
1.) Download the latest [release](https://github.com/x0Z3ro0x/FastGliders/releases/tag/2.0)

2.) Extract it inside your CS Server Mods folder

3.) Delete the ZIP file once all files are extracted

4.) Launch the server and make sure to enable the mod

5.) Enjoy!
